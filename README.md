OSMonitor
=========
OSMonitor is a tool that analyzes OpenStreetMap data and produces various reports, including:

* statistics, e.g. coverage ("Does OSM have all streets in my city?")
* syntactic issues with the map (similar to OSM Bugs)
* semantic issues with the map, e.g. "Is the longest river in OSM in fact the longest river in the world?"
* (hopefully) many more useful ones
